We seek to solve this problem through an application that everyone can access, so that jobs can be provided more easily, 
apart from this we are a foundation focused on helping with this problem by
providing training in different tasks, and teaching basic things if necessary (illiterate people).

We see that the main
problem is the lack of employment and that we are in a society where opportunities are focused on the most prepared.
We have the idea of always wanting the best without thinking that there are people with knowledge, arts, gifts, etc.
This makes people stand out to differentiate them since they are unique things that identify us,
taking this into account there are people who know the arts of different tasks and who do them in the correct way.
This is what we seek to help, so that women can be certified and can be
given advice or inductions to jobs and that they can correspond.

    Dear mothers, I know that facing unemployment can be a daunting challenge, but remember that your courage and strength do not depend on a job.
    Every day, with your love and dedication, you are building a better future for your children and for yourself.
    Keep faith in your abilities and your capacity to overcome obstacles. Sometimes the road may be difficult,
    but every step you take is a testament to your resilience. Keep moving forward with courage and confidence,
    because your effort and determination can transform any situation.!
